# Titanic-data-EDA
Introduction
"Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone, and welcome to my presentation on the Titanic dataset. The sinking of the Titanic remains one of the most tragic and memorable events in history. In 1912, the luxurious ocean liner, the Titanic, sank on its maiden voyage after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the loss of more than 1,500 lives.

This dataset provides valuable insights into the passengers and crew aboard the Titanic, including demographic information, socio-economic status, and survival rates. Through analysis and visualization of this data, we can gain a deeper understanding of the events that unfolded during this disaster.

In this presentation, we will explore the Titanic dataset and uncover interesting patterns and trends that emerge from the data. We will examine factors such as age, gender, class, and family status to determine their impact on survival rates.

Without further ado, let's dive into the Titanic dataset and see what it can teach us about this tragic event in history."â€ƒ
The aforementioned project was executed under the expert guidance of Professor Anna Androvitsanea and was presented by Sharik Pathan, who is currently enrolled in GTM 05 (Data Science) for the subject of Information and Learning Procedures. The project entailed performing Exploratory Data Analysis using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The resultant analysis provides valuable insights that address the 8 questions set forth by the professor. The source code for this project will be made available on GitHub at the following link. Additionally, the titanic.xls file contains data pertaining to 887 actual passengers aboard the Titanic. This dataset furnishes information regarding the passengers and includes a column that indicates whether each passenger survived (denoted as "1") or did not survive (denoted as "0").
The columns in the dataset are:
passengers: Passenger Identity
survived: Whether passenger survived or not
pclass: Class of ticket
sex: Sex of passenger (Male or Female)
age: Age of passenger
sibSp: Number of sibling and/or spouse travelling with passenger
parch: Number of parent and/or children travelling with passenger
ticket: Ticket number
fare: Price of ticket
cabin: Cabin number
